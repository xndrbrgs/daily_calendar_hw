# Work Day Scheduler

The daily scheduler was created to allow a user to save events for each hour of the day! This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and Moment.js. Bootstrap was also used to be able to generate each of the rows that keep all of the saved text safe and sound.

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
